# Timestamp Tracking Feature Implementation

## Overview

The TikTok Search Tool has been enhanced with automatic timestamp tracking functionality. This feature records when each video link was discovered and added to the Excel database, providing valuable temporal information about your search activities.

## What Changed

### 1. Enhanced Excel Configuration (`config.py`)

**Updated Headers:**
```python
"headers": ['URL', 'Username', 'Video ID', 'Title', 'Search Query', 'Added Date']
```

### 2. Enhanced TikTok Searcher (`tiktok_searcher.py`)

**New Import:**
```python
import datetime
```

**Enhanced Video Data Creation:**
```python
# Get current timestamp for when this video was added
current_timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

video_info = {
    'url': link,
    'username': username,
    'video_id': video_id,
    'title': f"Video by @{username}",
    'search_query': query,
    'added_date': current_timestamp  # New timestamp field
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Excel Manager (`excel_manager.py`)

**Updated Data Mapping:**
```python
# Map video data to columns (now includes timestamp)
self.worksheet.cell(row=row, column=6, value=video.get('added_date', ''))
```

## How It Works

### Timestamp Generation
- **Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` (e.g., "2025-08-31 00:28:16")
- **Generation**: Automatically created when each video is discovered
- **Storage**: Stored in the "Added Date" column of Excel files

### Integration with Duplicate Checking
- **New Videos**: Get current timestamp when added
- **Duplicate Videos**: Preserve original timestamp (not overwritten)
- **Historical Tracking**: Maintains complete timeline of discoveries

## Example Output

### Excel File Structure
| URL | Username | Video ID | Title | Search Query | Added Date |
|-----|----------|----------|-------|--------------|------------|
| https://www.tiktok.com/@user1/video/1234567890 | user1 | 1234567890 | Video by @user1 | funny cats | 2025-08-31 00:28:16 |
| https://www.tiktok.com/@user2/video/9876543210 | user2 | 9876543210 | Video by @user2 | funny cats | 2025-08-31 00:28:17 |
| https://www.tiktok.com/@user3/video/5556667777 | user3 | 5556667777 | Video by @user3 | cute dogs | 2025-08-31 00:31:45 |

## Benefits

### 1. Temporal Tracking
- **Discovery Timeline**: See when each video was found
- **Search History**: Track when searches were performed
- **Data Age**: Identify how old video data is

### 2. Database Management
- **Growth Monitoring**: See how your collection grows over time
- **Search Patterns**: Understand when you perform searches
- **Data Freshness**: Identify stale or recent data

### 3. Analysis Capabilities
- **Trend Analysis**: See which periods had more discoveries
- **Search Efficiency**: Track search performance over time
- **Data Quality**: Monitor data collection patterns

### 4. Audit Trail
- **Complete History**: Full record of when videos were added
- **Search Accountability**: Track all search activities
- **Data Provenance**: Know the source and timing of all data

## Use Cases

### 1. Research and Analysis
```python
# Filter videos by discovery date
# Find videos discovered in the last week
# Analyze search patterns over time
```

### 2. Database Maintenance
```python
# Identify old data that might need updating
# Track database growth rates
# Monitor search activity patterns
```

### 3. Quality Control
```python
# Verify when data was collected
# Ensure data freshness
# Track data collection efforts
```

## Technical Details

### Timestamp Format
- **Standard**: ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
- **Timezone**: Local system timezone
- **Precision**: Second-level precision
- **Consistency**: Same format across all entries

### Integration Points
- **Video Discovery**: Timestamp added when video is found
- **Excel Export**: Timestamp included in Excel column
- **Duplicate Checking**: Timestamps preserved for existing entries
- **Data Preservation**: Original timestamps never overwritten

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal Overhead**: Timestamp generation is very fast
- **No Storage Issues**: Timestamps are small text strings
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing files work without timestamps

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Building a Video Database
```bash
# Day 1: Initial search
python main.py "funny cats"
# Creates file with timestamps: 2025-08-31 10:00:00

# Day 2: Same search (finds new videos)
python main.py "funny cats"
# Adds new videos with timestamps: 2025-08-31 14:30:00

# Day 3: Different search
python main.py "cute dogs"
# Adds videos with timestamps: 2025-09-01 09:15:00
```

### Scenario 2: Research Project
```bash
# Week 1: Initial data collection
python main.py "dance videos"
python main.py "cooking tutorial"

# Week 2: Follow-up searches
python main.py "dance videos"  # Finds new videos
python main.py "fitness tips"

# Week 3: Analysis
# Excel file shows complete timeline of discoveries
```
